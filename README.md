This project was made with the use of technologies like jQuery, Bootstrap, MySQL, PHP, Google Charts, JavaScript and HTML5. I used PHP for the backend API because it allowed me to deploy the project on the team's web server. I used jQuery for request handling, because it's something I'm familiar with, in addition to it being used so many places in web development. Google Charts is fantastic for creating custom charts. I used MySQL for the database because it works great with PHP. Bootstrap is a simple, easy to use styling library, which makes it perfect for something that doesn't need much styling.
